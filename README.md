# Project 1 "EV sales"

# KEY INSIGHT
The dashboard shows a total of 3.59 million EV sales in India. Yearly sales have seen steady growth from 2014 to 2021, followed by a sharp rise in 2022 and peaking in 2023. However, there's a significant drop in 2024, indicating a potential market slowdown or incomplete data. Monthly trends show steady sales with a peak in November, while categories with the highest sales are two dominant vehicle classesâ€”1.69M and 1.40M units respectively.

Geographically, states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka lead in EV sales, while many northern and northeastern regions lag behind. The top 5 vehicle types dominate the market with clear preferences shown in the donut chart. Despite high quarterly and monthly sales totals, the year-on-year consistency and regional disparity highlight the need for broader adoption and sustainable infrastructure.
