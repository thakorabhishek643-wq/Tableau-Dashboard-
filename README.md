# PROJECT 1  " EV SALES "

# KEY INSIGHT
The dashboard shows a total of 3.59 million EV sales in India. Yearly sales have seen steady growth from 2014 to 2021, followed by a sharp rise in 2022 and peaking in 2023. However, there's a significant drop in 2024, indicating a potential market slowdown or incomplete data. Monthly trends show steady sales with a peak in November, while categories with the highest sales are two dominant vehicle classes—1.69M and 1.40M units respectively.

Geographically, states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka lead in EV sales, while many northern and northeastern regions lag behind. The top 5 vehicle types dominate the market with clear preferences shown in the donut chart. Despite high quarterly and monthly sales totals, the year-on-year consistency and regional disparity highlight the need for broader adoption and sustainable infrastructure.

 #  PROJECT 3 "FINANCIAL DATA" 
 
 # KPI's 
 Total sales = " $118.73 M" <br />
 Total turnover  =  " $128 M" <br />
 Profit margin  = " 14 % " <br />
 COGS to sales = " 86 % " <br />
 
# KEY INSIGHT 
The financial dashboard shows a total sales value of $118.73M with a profit margin of 14%, while COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) accounts for a high 86% of total sales, indicating tight margins and high production or operational costs. The majority of revenue was generated in 2014 ($92.31M), showing a significant growth from 2013 ($26.42M). Among products, Paseo leads with $33.01M in sales, followed by VTT and Velo, while Carretera shows the lowest performance at $13.82M.

Manufacturing costs are concentrated, with 40.35% of the cost coming from a specific category, hinting at a potential optimization opportunity. Country-wise, Canada and the USA are major contributors to sales and profit, with figures above $100K. Segment-wise, Government is the most profitable market with $52.5M in sales, followed by Enterprise ($42.43M), while Channel Partners contribute the least. The monthly trend indicates seasonality or promotional spikes, suggesting that sales and profit fluctuate throughout the year. Overall, the data points to strong product and segment performers, but also highlights high production costs that could be streamlined to improve margins.

# PROJECT 4 "HR SUMMARY" 

# KPI's 
 Total hire = " 311 " <br />
 Total active  =  " 207 " <br />
 Profit terminated  = " 104 " <br />
 
# KEY INSIGHT  
The HR dashboard shows that out of 311 employees hired, 207 are currently active while 104 have been terminated. Most employees belong to the Production department, followed by IT/IS and Sales. The workforce is male-dominated (57% male, 43% female), and the majority of employees fall in the 30–45 age group. A large portion of the team has over 10 years of experience.

From a performance perspective, most employees meet expectations, though performance dips slightly in the 45+ age group. The majority of staff are single, followed by married individuals. High-salaried roles are mostly executive and leadership positions such as President & CEO, CIO, and Directors, with salaries rising with age and experience.

In terms of hiring sources, Indeed is the most effective, bringing in 87 employees, followed by LinkedIn and Google Search. The employee base is largely located in Massachusetts, with smaller clusters in states like Texas and Colorado. These insights suggest a stable workforce with room to improve retention, performance management, and departmental diversity

 The employee data reveals a diverse workforce spread across multiple departments, with a noticeable concentration in Production, particularly in roles like Production Technician I. Most employees are based in Massachusetts (MA), with others located in CA, TX, ND, and CT. A majority of the employees have long tenures, with several having over 10–15 years of service, reflecting strong employee retention in many roles. The length of hire ranges from 4 to 19 years, with the longest-serving employee hired in 2006.

Salaries vary significantly across roles and departments. Positions like CIO and Software Engineer earn higher salaries (e.g., $220.5K and $109K respectively), whereas roles in Production or IT Support have moderate earnings between $46K to $74K. Most employees appear to be still hired, though a few such as "Lynch" and "Patronick" were terminated after relatively short tenures (4 years each).

Overall, the organization demonstrates stable long-term employment in core operational roles, with room to investigate reasons behind some early terminations. Additionally, the high salary differences suggest a clear hierarchy and specialization across departments like IT/IS, Sales, and Engineering.

# PROJECT 5 "PIZZA SALES" 

# KPI's 
 Total revenue = " $817.9 K " <br />
 Avg order value =  " 38.3 " <br />
 Total pizza sold  = " 49.6 K " <br />
 Total order = " 21.4 K"  <br />
 Avg pizza per order = " 2.32 "  <br />

# KEY INSIGHT  
The provided pizza sales dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of key performance metrics for a pizza business over the year 2015. The total revenue generated was approximately $817.9K, with an average order value of $38.3 and 21.4K total orders placed, resulting in nearly 49.6K pizzas sold. The busiest sales hours are between 12:00 PM and 1:00 AM, and the 48th week marks the peak in weekly orders. The hourly trend graph shows the highest sales activity around 12 PM to 1 PM, with revenue peaking at $6.8K during that hour.

From a category and size perspective, Classic pizzas contributed the most to total sales and orders, accounting for 27% of sales revenue ($220,053), followed closely by Supreme and Chicken categories. Large-sized pizzas dominate the sales by size, comprising 45.9% of total sales, indicating customer preference for larger portions. Medium and Regular sizes follow with 30.5% and 21.8% contributions, respectively, while X-large and XX-large pizzas make up a minimal share. The sales performance section highlights that the combination of Classic category and Large size yields the highest sales volume.

The data also shows an interesting pattern in the total order vs. pizza sold per category. While Classic pizzas had the highest number of total orders (14,888) and positive pizza sales (10,859), there remains a notable gap indicating either order cancellations, returns, or recording errors. The weekly trend shows a generally consistent order volume with an average of around 403 orders per week, peaking in the 48th week at 491 and dropping sharply at the end of the year. These insights can help the business focus on maximizing popular product offerings during peak hours and weeks for higher profitability.

This pizza sales report provides a deeper breakdown of performance by individual pizza types, highlighting both top and bottom performers. The total revenue remains consistent at $817.9K with 49.6K pizzas sold and an average order value of $38.3. The Thai Chicken Pizza leads in revenue generation with $43.4K, followed closely by the Barbecue Chicken and California Chicken pizzas. However, when it comes to quantity sold and orders placed, the Classic Deluxe Pizza outperforms all others, securing the top spot in both pizza sold and total orders, indicating its popularity and strong customer preference.

The report also identifies underperforming items across key metrics. The Brie Carre Pizza ranks lowest in all three categories—revenue ($11.6K), quantity sold ($490), and total orders (480)—making it the weakest product on the menu. Other low-performing pizzas include the Spinach Supreme, Mediterranean, and Green Garden Pizzas, which consistently appear in the bottom five across revenue, sales quantity, and order count. This suggests that these items may need to be reviewed for possible replacement, recipe improvement, or targeted marketing strategies to increase demand.

From a strategic standpoint, there’s a clear distinction between pizzas that drive revenue and those that attract higher sales volume. While Thai Chicken Pizza generates the highest revenue, it doesn't lead in sales volume or orders—indicating a higher price point or value per unit. Conversely, the Classic Deluxe Pizza dominates in volume, making it a key driver of customer engagement. These insights can guide product prioritization, pricing strategies, and promotional efforts. Focusing on bestsellers like the Classic Deluxe and optimizing or replacing low performers like the Brie Carre could significantly enhance overall sales performance.

# PROJECT 6 "SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT" 

# KPI's 
Total order = " 100 " <br />
Revenue generated = " 577.6 K " <br />
Avg delivery time = " 6 " <br />
On time delivery rate = " 83% " <br />
Order quantity = " 4.9 K " <br />
No of product sold = " 46.1 K " <br />
Avg TU rate = " 483 " <br />

# KEY INSIGHT
The supply chain data reveals strong overall performance, with 100 total orders generating ₹577.6K in revenue and an average delivery time of 6 days. A solid on-time delivery rate of 83% and a high inventory turnover ratio of 483 indicate efficient order fulfillment and inventory movement. Road transportation stands out as the fastest mode (4.7 days), while Route C achieves the highest on-time delivery rate at 85%.

However, quality control presents a concern — over 25K units are still pending inspection, and the number of failed inspections (18.8K) surpasses the passed ones (12.6K), signaling possible product quality or compliance issues. Additionally, supplier cost variation, especially from Supplier 1, suggests a need to reassess route-supplier combinations to reduce logistics expenses.

The dashboard highlights a strong supply chain performance with ₹577.6K in revenue across 100 total orders and 46.1K products sold. Skincare products generate the highest revenue (₹241.6K), followed by haircare and cosmetics. Among cities, major order quantities are distributed relatively evenly across Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, showing a balanced geographic demand. Route performance varies: one route achieves a 93.75% on-time rate while another drops to 66.67%, indicating inconsistency in delivery reliability.


In shipping logistics, haircare products primarily use Carrier B, while skincare is more spread across different carriers, hinting at a fragmented shipping strategy. Order volumes also vary by supplier, with Suppliers 1 and 2 handling the most. Demographic trends show skincare is especially popular among females and non-binary customers, while haircare sees high engagement from unknown demographic groups. Overall, while product performance and distribution are solid, the company could improve delivery consistency and better streamline shipping partnerships
