# Project 1 "EV sales"

# KEY INSIGHT
The dashboard shows a total of 3.59 million EV sales in India. Yearly sales have seen steady growth from 2014 to 2021, followed by a sharp rise in 2022 and peaking in 2023. However, there's a significant drop in 2024, indicating a potential market slowdown or incomplete data. Monthly trends show steady sales with a peak in November, while categories with the highest sales are two dominant vehicle classes—1.69M and 1.40M units respectively.

Geographically, states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka lead in EV sales, while many northern and northeastern regions lag behind. The top 5 vehicle types dominate the market with clear preferences shown in the donut chart. Despite high quarterly and monthly sales totals, the year-on-year consistency and regional disparity highlight the need for broader adoption and sustainable infrastructure.

# PROJECT 4 "HR SUMMARY" 
# KPI's 
 Total hire = " 311 " <br />
 Total active  =  " 207 " <br />
 Profit terminated  = " 104 " <br />
 
# KEY INSIGHT  
The HR dashboard shows that out of 311 employees hired, 207 are currently active while 104 have been terminated. Most employees belong to the Production department, followed by IT/IS and Sales. The workforce is male-dominated (57% male, 43% female), and the majority of employees fall in the 30–45 age group. A large portion of the team has over 10 years of experience.

From a performance perspective, most employees meet expectations, though performance dips slightly in the 45+ age group. The majority of staff are single, followed by married individuals. High-salaried roles are mostly executive and leadership positions such as President & CEO, CIO, and Directors, with salaries rising with age and experience.

In terms of hiring sources, Indeed is the most effective, bringing in 87 employees, followed by LinkedIn and Google Search. The employee base is largely located in Massachusetts, with smaller clusters in states like Texas and Colorado. These insights suggest a stable workforce with room to improve retention, performance management, and departmental diversity

 The employee data reveals a diverse workforce spread across multiple departments, with a noticeable concentration in Production, particularly in roles like Production Technician I. Most employees are based in Massachusetts (MA), with others located in CA, TX, ND, and CT. A majority of the employees have long tenures, with several having over 10–15 years of service, reflecting strong employee retention in many roles. The length of hire ranges from 4 to 19 years, with the longest-serving employee hired in 2006.

Salaries vary significantly across roles and departments. Positions like CIO and Software Engineer earn higher salaries (e.g., $220.5K and $109K respectively), whereas roles in Production or IT Support have moderate earnings between $46K to $74K. Most employees appear to be still hired, though a few such as "Lynch" and "Patronick" were terminated after relatively short tenures (4 years each).

Overall, the organization demonstrates stable long-term employment in core operational roles, with room to investigate reasons behind some early terminations. Additionally, the high salary differences suggest a clear hierarchy and specialization across departments like IT/IS, Sales, and Engineering.
